Problem Statement
Understanding the problem statement is the first and foremost step. This would help you give an intuition of what you will face ahead of time. Let us see the problem statement -

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.

This is a standard supervised classification task.A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).Classification can be of two types:

Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.

Binary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc.

Multiclass Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc.

Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.

Although this notebook is specifically built to give you a walkthrough of Loan Prediction problem, you can always refer the content to get a comprehensive overview to solve a classification problem.

Hypothesis Generation
After looking at the problem statement, we will now move into hypothesis generation. It is the process of listing out all the possible factors that can affect the outcome.

What is hypothesis generation?
This is a very important stage in any data science/machine learning pipeline. It involves understanding the problem in detail by brainstorming as many factors as possible which can impact the outcome. It is done by understanding the problem statement thoroughly and before looking at the data.

Below are some of the factors which I think can affect the Loan Approval (dependent variable for this loan prediction problem):

Salary: Applicants with high income should have more chances of loan approval.

Previous history: Applicants who have repayed their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.

Loan amount: Loan approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.

Loan term: Loan for less time period and less amount should have higher chances of approval.

EMI: Lesser the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, higher the chances of loan approval.

These are some of the factors which i think can affect the target variable, you can come up with many more factors

About The Data:
Given below is the description for each variable.

Variable ----- Description

Loan_ID -->> Unique Loan ID

Gender -->> Male/ Female

Married -->> Applicant married (Y/N)

Dependents -->> Number of dependents

Education -->> Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)

Self_Employed -->> Self employed (Y/N)

ApplicantIncome -->> Applicant income

CoapplicantIncome -->> Coapplicant income

LoanAmount -->> Loan amount in thousands

Loan_Amount_Term -->> Term of loan in months

Credit_History -->> credit history meets guidelines

Property_Area -->> Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural

Loan_Status -->> Loan approved (Y/N)
